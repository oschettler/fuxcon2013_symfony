Welcome to the installation of the Symfony version of the project site for the FUxCon 2013 workshop.

This software and documentation is released under the GNU General Public License 
(version 3). Please review the license in LICENSE.txt.

This script will download and setup some dependencies and the database. 
It assumes that you have created a MySQL database "fuxcon2013_symfony" 
and a database user "fuxcon" with password "fuxcon" for it. 

If you still need to do this, please press ^C now 
and restart the installation once you are ready.
